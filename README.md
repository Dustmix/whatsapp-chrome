# Whatsapp for ChromeOS

## Introduction?

This project packages WhatsApp for Web inside a Chrome App for ChromeOS. 
This ***should*** also work on some Chromium based browsers, but if you're using Windows or MacOS, use the official client.
**This won't work anymore on ChromeOS or Chrome in 2021 as they are discontinuing it. Just use the PWA app, this was just an experiment.**

 4. Press "Load unpacked extension..." 
 5. Select the folder with the app's files inside
